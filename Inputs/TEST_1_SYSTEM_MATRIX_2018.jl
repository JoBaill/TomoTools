#Test Build_system_matrix 3D

#In order to simplify the computation by hand of the results, we had to change
#    for z = (-_box_length_z + z_pixel_length) / 2:_dist_z:(_box_length_z - z_pixel_length) / 2
# and replace it by:
# for z = (0.0):_dist_z:(_box_length_z - z_pixel_length) / 2

# Testing is made by calculating the first values per hand, and once verified with
# the modified code, we switched back the code to the original one. That change
# was only on the z-height so that the values were easier to calculate.
#
# The order of the projections in the matrix is quite unusual. We calculate,
#
# 0) for each source-to-detecter-pannel pair, the vertical-central-detectors (VCD)
# For a vertical group of detector we start with the upper one, going down (Zaxis)
#
# 1)Then, we calculate the vertical-detectors that are closest to the VCD
# COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Those will also be made from up to down (in the Z-axis).
# We here define Clockwise by: Source would be the origin, VCD[2] the (0,0,1)
#
#
# 2)Then, we calculate the vertical-detectors that are closest to the VCD
# CLOCKWISE. Those will also be made from up to down (in the Z-axis).
#
# We then continue step 1) and 2) with the second closest one and etc.
#
# When we are done with a projection, we rotate the gantry (for the SSCT version)
# and we restart step 0), 1) and 2). Rotation of the gantry implies a new
# source-to-detecter-pannel pair.
#
# Once the gantry has been fully rotated, we increase the z-height
